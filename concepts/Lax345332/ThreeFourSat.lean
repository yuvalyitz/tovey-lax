title: (3,4)-satisfiability is NP-hard
type: theorem
---
*(3,4)-SAT* is satisfiability restricted to formulas in which every clause contains
exactly three literals and every variable occurs at most four times. Tovey proved that it
is NP-hard: every language in NP has a polynomial-time many-one reduction to it.

# Formalization notes

The restriction is a predicate on the CNF formulas of the archive's Cook–Levin submission,
so the encoding and the notion of satisfiability are shared with unrestricted SAT.
Occurrences are counted with multiplicity.
